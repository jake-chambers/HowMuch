## About <a name = "about"></a>
I currently work as a developer at an investment company. I have the opportunity to fiddle around with a lot of data regarding stocks, bonds, etc. I was interested in what the returns would be today if you invested in certain stocks at some past date. There was no application online that I found that could take care of this request so I built one myself.
